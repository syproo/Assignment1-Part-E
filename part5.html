        <h2>Jasper AI: how to use the<br>ChatGPT alternative now</h2>
        <p>
            Jasper AI is a powerful, new alternative to ChatGPT that offers quick,<br> 
            generative text with no waitlist. You probably haven’t heard of Jasper <br>
            AI, originally known as Jarvis AI, until Marvel challenged the name that <br>
             conflicted with Iron Man’s AI companion.

        <h2>How much does Jasper cost?</h2>
        <p>Unlike ChatGPT, you can’t continue to use Jasper Chat for free. After the<br> 
            trial ends, you must subscribe. The cost starts at $60 per month, or $50<br> 
            per month if you commit to an annual subscription. That’s a steep price for<br> 
            consumers, but might makes sense in a business budget if you regularly create<br> 
            several documents, blog posts, advertisements, and emails daily.<br><br>

            You can use Jasper Chat to generate up to 50,000 words each month at the<br> 
            starting price, which is about 2,500 words per day. That’s equivalent to<br> 
            the output of a prolific professional writer, which would cost much more<br> 
            to have on staff.</p>
